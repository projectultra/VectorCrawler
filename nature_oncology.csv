Gunter', 'Laure Dossus']",2024-09-24,British Journal of Cancer,"Adiposity is a known risk factor for certain cancers; however, it is not clear whether the risk of cancer differs between individuals with high adiposity but different metabolic health status. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis of cohort studies was to evaluate associations between metabolic obesity phenotypes and overall and site-specific cancer risk."
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-73346-3,Association of female sex with cataract surgery in the general population but not in plaque brachytherapy-treated uveal melanoma patients,"['Anna Hagström', 'Shiva Sabazade', 'Viktor Gill', 'Gustav Stålhammar']",2024-09-24,Scientific Reports,"Cataract is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, necessitating a deeper understanding of its risk factors. We analyzed two cohorts: 1000 individuals from the general Swedish population and 933 patients who received plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma. Using Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence analyses, as well as Cox and competing risk regressions, we assessed whether there is a relationship between sex and cataract surgery. In the general population, female sex was a significant risk factor for cataract surgery, with a 10-year incidence of 16% compared to 10% for males (subdistribution hazard ratio adjusted for age, 1.35, P < 0.001). In the brachytherapy cohort, female sex was not associated with an increased incidence of cataract surgery, with a 10-year incidence of 25% versus 23% for males (HR 1.08, P = 0.61). Visual acuity at the time of cataract surgery did not significantly differ between sexes in either cohort, suggesting that differences in surgery rates are not due to health-seeking behavior or surgery assessment thresholds. These findings indicate that female sex is associated with a higher risk of cataract surgery in the general population, but not among those treated with plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma."

Shaitelman', 'Nina Tamirisa', 'Yu Shen', 'Isabelle Bedrosian']",2024-09-20,npj Breast Cancer,"Clinical trials of active surveillance (AS) for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) are underway. We sought to understand the historical management of biologically favorable DCIS and to determine the outcomes of patients who did not have immediate surgery. Using data from the NCDB from 2004 to 2017, the selected cohort included women >40 years of age, with low or intermediate grade and hormone receptor (HR) positive DCIS. AS was defined as either no surgery or surgery >12 months from diagnosis. Women in the AS group were compared to women who had immediate surgery. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the trend of AS over year of diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated to compare overall survival (OS), stratified by age (<50, 50–64, ≥65), and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effects of prognostic factors on survival distributions. 74,367 women met study inclusion criteria; 2384 (3.2%) were treated with AS. The proportion of patients in the AS cohort increased yearly, peaking in 2017 at 4.2% (p < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, increasing age (OR 1.02, p < 0.01), black race (OR 1.7, p < 0.001), and being uninsured (OR 2.2, p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of AS. In women <50 years of age, OS outcomes were similar, with 10-year OS of 97.4% in the immediate surgery cohort versus 99.1% in AS cohort (p = 0.43). The proportion of patients with DCIS treated with AS has remained small but is increasing over time. AS of biologically favorable DCIS in younger, healthier women is not associated with adverse survival."

We previously demonstrated the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in GBM cell migration and resistance to ionizing radiation. The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3, responsible for CXCL12 scavenging, was previously suggested as additional important player in the context of GBM. Following validation of the detection tools, we observed that ACKR3 is expressed within GBM patient tumor tissue, distributed in diverse cell types. In contrast to CXCR4, ACKR3 expression in patient-derived stem-like cells (GSCs) remains however low, while ACKR3 gene expression by tumor cells appears to be modulated by the in-vivo environment. Using overexpression models, we also showed that in vitro ACKR3 had no significant direct effect on cell proliferation or invasion. Altogether, these results suggest that in vitro ACKR3 plays a minor role in malignant GBM cell biology and that its expression is possibly regulated by in-vivo influences. The subtle and multifaceted functions ACKR3 could exert in GBM should therefore only be tackled within a comprehensive tumor microenvironment considering tumoral but also non-tumoral cells."

Gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel (GnP) is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC); however, predictive markers for its efficacy remain unestablished. This study evaluated the association between GnP’s therapeutic effects and Mcl-1 expression in tissue samples obtained using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for pancreatic tumor or percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy for metastatic liver tumor. We retrospectively reviewed 38 patients with histologically diagnosed MPC who received GnP as the first-line chemotherapy at our institute between December 2014 and July 2018. Post-immunohistochemistry analysis for Mcl-1 expression detection, patients were divided to into two groups based on the cell proportion showing Mcl-1 immunoreactivity: positive (> 20%; 23 [60.5%] patients) and negative (≤ 20%; 15 [39.5%] patients) groups. Clinical characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The Mcl-1 positive group showed a significantly higher disease control rate (95.7% vs. 73.3%; P = 0.046), longer progressionfree survival (PFS) (7.2 months vs. 4.9 months; P = 0.018) and longer overall survival (OS) (14.9 months vs. 9.2 months; P = 0.008) than the Mcl-1 negative group. Multivariate analysis showed that Mcl-1 expression was an independent predictive marker for PFS and OS. Mcl-1 expression could be a predictive marker for favorable response to GnP."

We demonstrate preclinical synergy of telaglenastat (CB-839), a selective glutaminase inhibitor, combined with azacytidine (AZA), followed by a single-arm, open-label, phase 1b/2 study in persons with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The dual primary endpoints evaluated clinical activity, safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints evaluated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, overall survival, event-free survival and duration of response. The dose-escalation study included six participants and the dose-expansion study included 24 participants. Therapy was well tolerated and led to an objective response rate of 70% with (marrow) complete remission in 53% of participants and a median overall survival of 11.6 months, with evidence of myeloid differentiation in responders determined by single-cell RNA sequencing. Glutamine transporter solute carrier family 38 member 1 in MDS stem cells was associated with clinical responses and predictive of worse prognosis in a large MDS cohort. These data demonstrate the safety and efficacy of CB-839 and AZA as a combined metabolic and epigenetic approach in MDS. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03047993."

Between January 2012 and July 2021, 527 patients with pathologically confirmed solitary solid pulmonary nodules were collected at dual centers with similar CT examinations and scanning parameters. Before surgery, all patients underwent both plain and contrast-enhanced chest CT scans. Two clinical characteristics, fifteen plain CT characteristics, and four enhanced characteristics were used to develop two logistic regression models: model 1 (plain CT only) and model 2 (plain + contrast CT). The diagnostic performance of the two models was assessed separately in the development and external validation cohorts using the AUC. 392 patients from Center A were included in the training cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 15.0–24.0] mm; mean age, 55.8 [SD, 9.9] years; male, 53.3%). 135 patients from Center B were included in the external validation cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 16.0–24.0] mm; mean age, 56.4 [SD, 9.6] years; male, 51.9%). Preoperative patients with 201 malignant (adenocarcinoma, 148 [73.6%]; squamous cell carcinoma, 35 [17.4%]; large cell carcinoma,18 [9.0%]) and 326 benign (pulmonary hamartoma, 118 [36.2%]; sclerosing pneumocytoma, 35 [10.7%]; tuberculosis, 104 [31.9%]; inflammatory pseudonodule, 69 [21.2%]) solitary solid pulmonary nodules were gathered from two independent centers. The mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, and AUC (95%CI) of model 1 (Plain CT only) were 0.79, 0.78, 0.79, 0.67, 0.87, and 0.88 (95%CI, 0.82–0.93), the model 2 (Plain + Contrast CT) were 0.88, 0.91, 0.90, 0.84, 0.93, 0.93 (95%CI, 0.88–0.98) in external validation cohort, respectively. A logistic regression model based on plain and contrast-enhanced CT characteristics showed exceptional performance in the evaluation of malignancy for solitary solid lung nodules. Utilizing this contrast-enhanced CT model would provide recommendations concerning follow-up or surgical intervention for preoperative patients presenting with solid lung nodules."

Patients who completed primary oral cancer treatment between September 2019 and March 2023 (102 patients, 74 male [72.5%] and 28 female [27.5%]; mean age, 69.6 years) were analyzed. Patient background data were collected from electronic medical records. Post-treatment oral function measurements were conducted on all patients using six assessment tools. Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, one-way analysis of variance, the Jonckheere–Terpstra test, and multiple linear regression. Pre-treatment BMI showed a statistically significant relationship with postoperative oral function, particularly tongue pressure (P = 0.01). While the mean values of the groups showed no significant differences, the Jonckheere–Terpstra test revealed a statistically significant trend toward a stepwise increase in tongue pressure for each BMI group (P = 0.03). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between tongue pressure and pre-treatment BMI (P < 0.05). Pre-treatment BMI was significantly associated with tongue pressure. Since BMI is a variable factor that can be controlled by nutritional therapy even before treatment, nutritional intervention, weight control, and treatment strategies including reconstructive interventions to maintain tongue pressure may be important in oral cancer treatment."

Patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic PDAC who had previously received gemcitabine-based therapies were randomized 1:1 to receive either HR070803 (60 mg/m2 anhydrous irinotecan hydrochloride, equal to 56.5 mg/m2 free base) or placebo, both in combination with 5-FU (2000 mg/m2) and LV (200 mg/m2), all given intravenously every two weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS). A total of 298 patients were enrolled and received HR070803 plus 5-FU/LV (HR070803 group, n = 149) or placebo plus 5-FU/LV (placebo group, n = 149). Median OS was significantly improved in the HR070803 group compared to the placebo group (7.4 months [95% CI 6.1–8.4] versus 5.0 months [95% CI 4.3–6.0]; HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.48–0.84]; two-sided p = 0.0019). The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the HR070803 group were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (19.0% versus 11.6% in placebo group) and decreased neutrophil count (12.9% versus 0 in placebo group). No treatment-related deaths occurred in the HR070803 group, while the placebo group reported one treatment-related death (abdominal infection). HR070803 in combination with 5-FU/LV has shown promising efficacy and manageable safety in advanced or metastatic PDAC in the second-line setting, representing a potential option in this patient population."

Here, we report non-invasive fractionated photodynamic therapy of bladder cancer with full-course real-time near-infrared-II imaging based on engineered X-ray-activated nanotransducers that contain lanthanide-doped nanoscintillators with concurrent emissions in visible and the second near-infrared regions and conjugated photosensitizers. Following intravesical instillation in mice with carcinogen-induced autochthonous bladder tumours, tumour-homing peptide-labelled nanotransducers realize enhanced tumour regression, robust recurrence inhibition, improved survival rates, and restored immune homeostasis under X-ray irradiation with accompanied near-infrared-II imaging. On-demand fractionated photodynamic therapy with customized doses is further achieved based on quantifiable near-infrared-II imaging signal-to-background ratios. Our study presents a promising non-invasive strategy to confront the current bladder cancer dilemma from diagnosis to treatment and prognosis."

Cordyceps militaris, a traditional Chinese medicine, emerges as a promising candidate in this regard. This study investigates the effects of cordycepin and C. militaris ethanolic extract (Cm-EE) on sensitizing cancer cells and regulating immune responses against breast cancer (BC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Cordycepin, pentostatin and adenosine were identified in Cm-EE. Cordycepin treatment decreased HLA-ABC-positive cells in pre-treated cancer cells, while Cm-EE increased NKG2D ligand and death receptor expression. Additionally, cordycepin enhanced NKG2D receptor and death ligand expression on CD3-negative effector immune cells, particularly on natural killer (NK) cells, while Cm-EE pre-treatment stimulated IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Co-culturing cancer cells with effector immune cells during cordycepin or Cm-EE incubation resulted in elevated cancer cell death. These findings highlight the potential of cordycepin and Cm-EE in improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy for BC and HCC."

Here, we examine chromosome copy number changes in cancers from more than 1800 self-reported Black patients. We find that tumors from self-reported Black patients are significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from self-reported white patients. This increase in WGD frequency is observed across multiple cancer types, including breast, endometrial, and lung cancer, and is associated with shorter patient survival. We further demonstrate that combustion byproducts are capable of inducing WGDs in cell culture, and cancers from self-reported Black patients exhibit mutational signatures consistent with exposure to these carcinogens. In total, these findings identify a type of genomic alteration that is associated with environmental exposures and that may influence racial disparities in cancer outcomes."

We created CHD1-deficient prostate cancer cell lines for genomic, drug sensitivity and functional homologous recombination (HR) activity analysis. Subclonal deletion of CHD1 was nearly three times as frequent in prostate tumors of African American than in European American men and it associates with rapid disease progression. CHD1 deletion was not associated with HR deficiency associated mutational signatures or HR deficiency as detected by RAD51 foci formation. This was consistent with the moderate increase of olaparib and talazoparib sensitivity with several CHD1 deficient cell lines showing talazoparib sensitivity in the clinically relevant concentration range. CHD1 loss may contribute to worse disease outcome in African American men."

Moreover, therapeutic strategy for MPAL remains unclear, and prognosis is overall poor. We performed multiomic single cell profiling of 14 newly diagnosed adult MPAL patients to characterize the inter- and intra-tumoral transcriptional, immunophenotypic, and genetic landscapes of MPAL. We show that neither genetic profile nor transcriptome reliably correlate with specific MPAL immunophenotypes. Despite this, we find that MPAL blasts express a shared stem cell-like transcriptional profile indicative of high differentiation potential. Patients with the highest differentiation potential demonstrate inferior survival in our dataset. A gene set score, MPAL95, derived from genes highly enriched in the most stem-like MPAL cells, is applicable to bulk RNA sequencing data and is predictive of survival in an independent patient cohort, suggesting a potential strategy for clinical risk stratification."

This study aimed to investigate how CD151 and MMP9 affect TNBC cell migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that CD151 and MMP9 were positively expressed in triple-negative breast cancer, and lymph node metastasis, the histological grade, and CD151 and MMP9 expression were found to be independent prognostic factors for the survival of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Cytological experiments indicated that the knockdown of CD151 or MMP9 slowed triple-negative breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion and increased the apoptosis rate. Compared with CD151 knockdown, double MMP9 and CD151 knockdown further promoted cell death and inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, β-catenin and p-GSK-3β were significantly downregulated. In summary, simultaneously silencing CD151 and MMP9 further suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells and promoted their apoptosis. One possible strategy for inducing this effect is to block the GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway."

While we previously identified a carcinoma tumor-intrinsic resistance pathway, basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition, here, employing a multipronged single-cell and spatial-omics approach, we identify an inflammation and therapy-enriched tumor state we term basal-to-inflammatory transition. Basal-to-inflammatory transition signature correlates with poor overall patient survival in many epithelial tumors. Basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition and basal-to-inflammatory transition occur in adjacent but distinct regions of a single tumor: basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition arises within the core tumor nodule, while basal-to-inflammatory transition emerges from a specialized inflammatory environment defined by a tumor-associated TREM1 myeloid signature. TREM1 myeloid-derived cytokines IL1 and OSM induce basal-to-inflammatory transition in vitro and in vivo through NF-κB, lowering sensitivity of patient basal cell carcinoma explant tumors to Smoothened inhibitor treatment. This work deepens our knowledge of the heterogeneous local tumor microenvironment and nominates basal-to-inflammatory transition as a drug-resistant but targetable tumor state driven by a specialized inflammatory microenvironment."

Mutations or loss of PTEN are common in breast cancer, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Understanding PTEN’s role is vital for targeted therapies. 276 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue blocks from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed for PTEN expression. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify and assess tumor related clinicopathological characteristics as well as patient demographics. These were statistically matched with PTEN expression. Only 27.5% of the breast cancer tumors were PTEN-positive. PTEN expression correlated significantly with smaller tumor size, lower tumor grade, positive estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and favorable/unfavorable Ki67 status (p < 0.001). No significant association was found with vascular invasion, histologic type, age, HER2 status, staging, or lymph node involvement (p > 0.05). The study confirms PTEN's association with favorable clinicopathological features in breast cancer, supporting its role as a prognostic marker. These findings underscore the importance of PTEN in breast cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore these findings confirm the prevalence of advanced stage and aggressive breast cancer tumors in Ghana."

A retrospective analysis of 135 TNBC patients (107 responders, 28 non-responders) treated with NAC from January 2015 to October 2022 was conducted. Non-responders were defined according to RECIST guidelines. Data included clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings, with radiomics features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, to train a stacking ensemble of 13 machine learning models. For subgroup analysis, propensity score matching was conducted to adjust for clinical disparities in NAC response. The efficacy of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) before and after matching. The model combining clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings achieved an AUROC of 0.752 (95% CI 0.644–0.860) for predicting non-responders, while radiomics-based models showed 0.749 (95% CI 0.614–0.884). An integrated model of radiomics, clinicopathologic factors, and clinical MRI findings reached an AUROC of 0.802 (95% CI 0.699–0.905). After propensity score matching, the hierarchical order of key radiomics features remained consistent. Our study demonstrated the potential of using machine learning models based on pretreatment MRI to non-invasively predict TNBC non-responders to NAC."

The core is formed by pH dependent polyamine salt aggregates (PSA) containing both the payloads and the shell is formed by RAW 264.7 cell derived exosomal fragments. Herein, phosphate driven polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH, MW:17,500 Da) PSA was formed in presence of miR-34a and DTX to form PAN34a+DTX. The formulation exhibited pH dependent DTX release with only 33.55 ± 2.12% DTX release at pH 7.2 and 75.21 ± 1.8% DTX release till 144 h at pH 5.5. At 1.21 molar ratio of phosphate to the amine (known as R value), efficient complexation of miR-34a (3.6 μM) in the PAN particles was obtained. PAN34a+DTX demonstrated particle size (163.86 ± 12.89 nm) and zeta-potential value of 17.53 ± 5.10 mV which upon exosomal fragment layering changed to − 7.23 ± 2.75 mV which is similar to the zeta-potential of the exosomal fragments, i.e., − 8.40 ± 1.79 mV. The final formulation Exo(PAN34a+DTX), loaded with 40 ng/mL DTX and 50 nM miR-34a exhibited 48.20 ± 4.59% cytotoxicity in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, 4T1. Co-localization of CM-DiI (red fluorescence) stained exosomal fragments and FAM-siRNA (green fluorescence) in the cytoplasm of 4T1 cells after 6 h of Exo(PANFAM) treatment confirmed the efficiency of the designed system to co-deliver two actives. Exo(PAN34a+DTX) also reduced BCL-2 expression (target gene for miR-34a) by 8.98 folds in comparison to free DTX confirming promising co-delivery and apoptosis inducing effect of Exo(PAN34a+DTX) in 4T1."

Existing methods like PET and prompt gamma imaging to localize Bragg peak face challenges of low precision and high complexity. Here we introduce a 3D protoacoustic imaging with a 2D matrix array of 256 ultrasound transducers compatible with 256 parallel data acquisition channels provides real-time imaging capability (up to 75 frames per second with 10 averages), achieving high precision (5 mm/5% Gamma index shows accuracy better than 95.73%) at depths of tens of centimeters. We have successfully implemented this method in liver treatment with 5 pencil beam scanning and in prostate cancer treatment on a human torso phantom using a clinical proton machine. This demonstrates its capability to accurately identify the Bragg peak in practical clinical scenarios. It paves the way for adaptive radiotherapy with real-time feedback, potentially revolutionizing radiotherapy by enabling closed-loop treatment for improved patient outcomes."

A VEGFR-targeting peptide VEGF125 − 136 (QR) was conjugated with a lytic peptide (KLU) to form a peptide–drug conjugate QR-KLU. And the efficacy of QR-KLU in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody for HCC therapy in vivo and in vitro were evaluated. QR-KLU inhibited the proliferation and migration of mouse HCC cell line (Hepa1–6) cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in a dose-dependent manner. In the subcutaneous Hepa1–6 tumor model, QR-KLU combined with the anti-PD-1 antibody substantially inhibited tumor growth, promoted tumor necrosis, and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. QR-KLU substantially inhibited hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF, promoted tumor vascular normalization, and increased cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T cell infiltration in the tumor. In addition, QR-KLU and anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrated a strong synergistic effect in promoting the activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells, reducing the expression of immune-inhibitory factors, and increasing the expression of immune-stimulatory factors. This study proposed a novel approach for enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody using a VEGFR-targeting peptide–drug conjugate in HCC therapy."

Boes']",2024-09-17,Scientific Reports,"The prognosis of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor, partly due to inadequate immune recognition of the tumor. Neuroblastomas display extremely low surface MHC-I, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) is involved in pathways that may affect the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. We proposed that therapeutic inhibition of GSK-3β might improve the surface display of MHC-I molecules on neuroblastoma cells, and therefore tested if targeting of GSK-3β using the inhibitor 9-ING-41 (Elraglusib) improves MHC-I-mediated CTL recognition. We analyzed mRNA expression data of neuroblastoma tumor datasets and found that non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas express higher GSK-3β levels than MYCN-amplified tumors. In non-MYCN-amplified cells SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH 9-ING-41 treatment enhanced MHC-I surface display and the expression levels of a subset of genes involved in MHC-I antigen processing and presentation. Further, 9-ING-41 treatment triggered increased STAT1 pathway activation, upstream of antigen presentation pathways in two of the three non-MYCN-amplified cell lines. Finally, in co-culture experiments with CD8 + T cells, 9-ING-41 improved immune recognition of the neuroblastoma cells, as evidenced by augmented T-cell activation marker levels and T-cell proliferation, which was further enhanced by PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition. Our preclinical study provides experimental support to further explore the GSK-3β inhibitor 9-ING-41 as an immunomodulatory agent to increase tumor immune recognition in neuroblastoma."

Breast cancer presents with lung metastasis but rarely kidney metastasis. Using this difference as an example, we queried the mechanism(s) behind the proclivity for organ-specific metastasis. We used spontaneous and implant models of metastatic mammary carcinoma coupled with inflammatory tissue fibrosis, single-cell sequencing analyses and functional studies to unravel the causal determinants of organ-specific metastasis. Here we show that lung metastasis is facilitated by angiopoietin 2 (Ang2)-mediated suppression of lung-specific endothelial tight junction protein Claudin 5, which is augmented by the inflammatory fibrotic microenvironment and prevented by anti-Ang2 blocking antibodies, while kidney metastasis is prevented by non-Ang2-responsive Claudins 2 and 10. Suppression of Claudins 2 and 10 was sufficient to induce the emergence of kidney metastasis. This study illustrates the influence of organ-specific vascular heterogeneity in determining organotropic metastasis, independent of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms."

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining anlotinib and sintilimab plus chemotherapy as a second line or later therapy for ES-SCLC patients. This is a phase II clinical trial (ChiCTR2100049390) conducting at Shandong Cancer Hospital. Patients with ES-SCLC and received at least one prior systemic treatment were enrolled. The trial design involved a combination therapy (sintilimab, anlotinib, and nab-paclitaxel) administered over six 21-day cycles, followed by maintenance sintilimab therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Circulating tumor DNA sequencing was employed for exploratory analysis. From July 2021 to April 2023, 25 eligible patients were enrolled. The confirmed ORR was 60% (95% CI: 38.7–78.9%) and the DCR was 76% (95% CI: 54.9–90.6%). The mPFS was 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.4–9.7), and the 6-month PFS rate was 49.2%. The mOS was 13.4 months (95% CI: 11.8-NR), with a 12-month survival rate of 62.2%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 80% of patients, with the most common being fatigue (40%) and nausea (32%). TRAEs of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 12% of patients. ctDNA analysis indicated that low on-treatment blood tumor mutation burden was associated with longer PFS and OS and a potential role of KMT2D mutation in treatment resistance. This combination therapy shows promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile as a second-line or later treatment for ES-SCLC, with genomic insights providing potential biomarkers for treatment response."

Clinical and follow-up data of 126 male patients with NFPAs treated by transnasal sphenoidal surgery from January 2011 to January 2021 in Fuzhou 900th Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Lasso regression analysis was used to screen the best predictors, and the predictors were further screened by multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram prediction model was constructed. The performance of the model was verified by three aspects: discrimination, calibration and clinical utility by using the consistency index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration curve, clinical decision curve (DCA) and Clinical impact curve (CIC).  Out of 126 cases, 7 (5.56%) showed postoperative tumor recurrence, and 18 (14.29%) exhibited postoperative residual regrowth (progression). Age (P = 0.024), maximum tumor diameter (P < 0.001), modified Knosp grade (P < 0.001), resection extent (P < 0.001), Ki67 (P < 0.001), pressure symptom (P < 0.001), Pre-op hypopituitarism (P = 0.048), Post-op new hypopituitarism (P = 0.017) showed significant differences among the recurrence group, the progression group, and the alleviation group. Three independent risk factors (Ki67, modified Knosp grade, and resection extent) affecting postoperative remission were used to construct a predictive model for long-term postoperative failure to remit. The C-index of the nomogram model was 0.823, suggesting that the model had a high discriminatory power, and the AUC of the area under the ROC curve was 0.9[95% CI (0.843, 0.958)].  A nomogram prediction model based on modified Knosp grading (grades 3B-4), resection extent (partial resection), and Ki-67 (≥ 3%) predicts the recurrence or progression of NFPAs in men after transnasal sphenoidal surgery."

Increasing the intracellular concentrations of Cu or I ions may efficiently inhibit tumor growth. However, efficient delivery of Cu and I ions into tumor cells is still a challenge, as Cu chelation and iodide salts are highly water-soluble and can release in untargeted tissue. Here we report mitochondria-targeted Cu-I cluster nanoparticles using the reaction of Cu+ and I− to form stable bovine serum albumin (BSA) radiation-induced phosphors (Cu-I@BSA). These solve the stability issues of Cu+ and I− ions. Cu-I@BSA exhibit bright radioluminescence, and easily conjugate with the emission-matched photosensitizer and targeting molecule using functional groups on the surface of BSA. Investigations in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that radioluminescence under low-dose X-ray irradiation excites the conjugated photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen, and combines with the radiosensitization mechanism of the heavy atom of iodine, resulting in efficient tumor inhibition in female mice. Furthermore, our study reveals that BSA protection causes the biodegradable Cu-I clusters to release free Cu and I ions and induce cell death by modulating mitochondrial function, damaging DNA, disrupting the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreasing ATP generation, amplifying oxidative stress, and boosting the Bcl-2 pathway."

PanCK pre-training was compared to foundation models and various architectures were explored for model backbone. Proper study design and sample procurement for training a generalizable model that captured variations in NSCLC H&E was studied. H&E imaging was performed on 112 samples (three centers, two scanner types, different staining and imaging protocols). Attention U-Net architecture was trained using the large panCK-based annotations dataset (68 samples, total area 10,326 [mm2]) followed by fine-tuning using a small pathologist annotations dataset (80 samples, total area 246 [mm2]). This approach resulted in mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 82% [77 87]. Using panCK pretraining provided better performance compared to foundation models and allowed for 70% reduction in pathologist annotations with no drop in performance.

Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative oral intake time, time to return of bowel function, time to ambulation, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, fluid replacement volume, length of hospital stay, total hospital expenses, complications, and patient satisfaction were recorded and compared between the two groups. Postoperative follow-up included assessment of postoperative functional scores, reoperation rates, SF-36 quality of life scores, and survival rates. The average follow-up time was 35.6 months (range: 12–56 months). There were no statistically significant differences in general characteristics, including age, surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, and preoperative medical history between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared to the control group, the intervention group had an earlier postoperative oral intake time, faster return of bowel function, rapid ambulation, and shorter hospital stays (P < 0.05).

The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves, while the clinical utility of the nomogram was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA). The LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age, sex, marital status, tumor size, M stage, surgery, and chemotherapy as independent prognostic factors. The ROC curve results demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS in the training cohort were 0.770, 0.756, and 0.783, respectively. In the validation cohort, the AUC values were 0.814, 0.763, and 0.771, respectively. Calibration curves indicated a high concordance between predicted and actual OS. The DCA demonstrated that the nomogram has significant clinical applicability. This nomogram provides reliable predictions and valuable guidance for personalized survival estimates and high-risk patient identification."

Neurosurgeons perform tumor resection based on tactile sensations. However, it takes years of surgical experience to appropriately distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue. Haptics is a technology related to the touch sensation. Haptic technology can amplify, transmit, record, and reproduce real sensations, and the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of an object can be quantified. In the present study, glioblastoma (SF126-firefly luciferase-mCherry [FmC], U87-FmC, U251-FmC) and malignant meningioma (IOMM-Lee-FmC, HKBMM-FmC) cell lines were transplanted into nude mice, and the stiffness of tumors and normal brain tissues were measured using our newly developed surgical forceps equipped with haptic technology. We found that all five brain tumor tissues were stiffer than normal brain tissue (p < 0.001), and that brain tumor pathology (three types of glioblastomas, two types of malignant meningioma) was significantly stiffer than normal brain tissue (p < 0.001 for all). Our findings suggest that tissue stiffness may be a useful marker to distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue during microsurgery, and that haptic forceps may help neurosurgeons to sense minute changes in tissue stiffness."

By comprehensively analyzing the cell line’s phenotype, molecular characteristics, biomarkers, and histological characteristics, we confirmed that GBC-X1 serves as a valuable model for investigating the pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer and developing therapeutic agents. GBC-X1 has been continuously cultured for one year, with over 60 stable passages. Morphologically, GBC-X1 exhibits typical features of epithelial tumors. The population doubling time of GBC-X1 is 32 h. STR analysis validated a high consistency between GBC-X1 and the patient’s primary tumor. Karyotype analysis revealed an abnormal hypertetraploid karyotype for GBC-X1, characterized by representative karyotypes of 98, XXXX del (4) p (12) del (5) p (21) der (10). Under suspension culture conditions, GBC-X1 efficiently forms tumor balls, while subcutaneous inoculation of GBC-X1 cells into NXG mice leads to xenograft formation with a rate of 80%. Drug sensitivity testing demonstrated that GBC-X1 is resistant to oxaliplatin and sensitive to 5-FU, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive expression of CK7, CK19, E-cadherin, MMP-2, CD44, SOX2, and TP53 in GBC-X1 cells, weak positive expression of Vimentin, and a Ki67 positive rate of 35%. Our research highlights GBC-X1 as a novel gallbladder cancer cell line and emphasizes its potential as an effective experimental model for investigating the pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer and drug development."

We analyzed data from the FAERS database (January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2023) using disproportionality and Bayesian methods. We identified 3076 cases of ADC-associated peripheral neuropathy. Our study revealed significant signals for all ADCs (ROR 1.82, 95% CI 1.76–1.89). ADCs with tubulin-binding payloads showed significant peripheral neuropathy signals (ROR 2.31, 95% CI 2.23–2.40), whereas those with DNA-targeting (ROR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39–0.59) and topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (ROR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48–0.66) payloads exhibited non-significant signals. Signals for peripheral sensory neuropathy were 4.83, 2.44, 2.74, and 2.21 (calculated based on IC025) for brentuximab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, while signals for peripheral motor neuropathy were 5.31, 0.34, 2.27, and 0.03, respectively. The median time to onset for all ADCs was 127 days (interquartile range 40–457). Tisotumab vedotin had the highest hospitalization rate at 26.67%, followed by brentuximab vedotin at 25.5%. Trastuzumab emtansine had the highest mortality rate ,with 80 deaths (11.96%) among 669 cases. Based on FAERS database, only ADCs with tubulin-binding payloads exhibited significant peripheral neuropathy signals. Brentuximab vedotin and enfortumab vedotin showed similar profiles for peripheral sensory neuropathy and motor neuropathy. Given the delayed time to onset and potentially poor outcomes, ADC-related peripheral neuropathy warrants significant attention."

However, the specific roles of different subpopulations of TAMs remain poorly understood. Two distinct cell types, glioma and myeloid cells, were identified through single-cell sequencing analysis in gliomas. Within the TAMs-associated weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module, FPR3 emerged as a hub gene and was found to be expressed on CD163+ macrophages, while also being associated with clinical outcomes. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment was undertaken to investigate the correlation between FPR3 expression and immune characteristics, revealing that FPR3 potentially plays a role in reshaping the glioma microenvironment. We identified a macrophage subset with the nonzero expression of CD163 and FPR3 (CD163+FPR3+). Using the expression profiles of CD163+FPR3+ macrophage-related signature, we employed ten machine learning algorithms to construct a prognostic model across six glioma cohorts. Subsequently, we employed an optimal algorithm to generate an artificial intelligence-driven prognostic signature specifically for CD163+FPR3+ macrophages. The development of this model was based on the average C-index observed in the aforementioned six cohorts. The risk score of this model consistently and effectively predicted overall survival, surpassing the accuracy of conventional clinical factors and 100 previously published signatures. Consequently, the CD163+FPR3+ macrophage-related score shows potential as a prognostic biomarker for glioma patients."

With a growing number of immune markers analysed, digital image analysis may facilitate broader TIME understanding, even in single-plex IHC data. To facilitate analyses of the latter an open-source image analysis pipeline, Tissue microarray MArker Quantification (TMArQ), was developed and applied to single-plex stainings for p53, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, FOXP3, and PD-L1 (SP142 antibody) in a 218-patient triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort with complementary pathology scorings, clinicopathological, whole genome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data. TMArQ’s cell counts for analysed immune markers were on par with results from alternative methods and consistent with both estimates from human pathology review, different quantifications and classifications derived from RNA-sequencing as well as known prognostic patterns of immune response in TNBC. The digital cell counts demonstrated how immune markers are coexpressed in the TIME when considering TNBC molecular subtypes and DNA repair deficiency, and how combination of immune status with DNA repair deficiency status can improve the prognostic stratification in chemotherapy treated patients. These results underscore the value and potential of integrating TIME and specific tumour intrinsic alterations/phenotypes for the molecular understanding of TNBC."

Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic medication, has demonstrated potential in enhancing progression-free survival (PFS) in EOC patients. Nevertheless, the identification of individuals at elevated risk of disease progression following treatment remains a challenging task. This study was to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model using retrospectively collected computed tomography (CT) plain scans of inoperable and recurrent EOC patients receiving bevacizumab treatment diagnosed between January 2013 and January 2024. A total of 525 patients from three different institutions were retrospectively included in the study and divided into training set (N = 400), internal test set (N = 97) and external test set (N = 28). The model’s performance was evaluated using Harrell’s C-index. Patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk group based on a predetermined cutoff in the training set. Additionally, a multimodal model was evaluated, incorporating the risk score generated by the DL model and the pretreatment level of carbohydrate antigen 125 as input variables. The Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) metric quantified the reclassification performance of our optimal model in comparison to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging model. The results indicated that DL model achieved a PFS predictive C-index of 0.73 in the internal test set and a C-index of 0.61 in the external test set, along with hazard ratios of 34.24 in the training set (95% CI: 21.7, 54.1; P < 0.001) and 8.16 in the internal test set (95% CI: 2.5, 26.8; P < 0.001). The multimodal model demonstrated a C-index of 0.76 in the internal test set and a C-index of 0.64 in the external test set. Comparative analysis against FIGO staging revealed an NRI of 0.06 (P < 0.001) for the multimodal model. The model presents opportunities for prognostic assessment, treatment strategizing, and ongoing patient monitoring."

We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6 years prior to cancer diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using exfoliated cervical cells for detection of somatic mutations as potential diagnostic biomarkers."

Despite its catastrophic impact on survival, the critical mediators responsible for cancer cachexia development remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a distinct subset of neutrophil-like monocytes, which we term cachexia-inducible monocytes (CiMs), emerges in the advanced cancer milieu and promotes skeletal muscle loss. Unbiased transcriptome analysis reveals that interleukin 36 gamma (IL36G)-producing CD38+ CiMs are induced in chronic monocytic blood cancer characterized by prominent cachexia. Notably, the emergence of CiMs and the activation of CiM-related gene signatures in monocytes are confirmed in various advanced solid cancers. Stimuli of toll-like receptor 4 signaling are responsible for the induction of CiMs. Genetic inhibition of IL36G-mediated signaling attenuates skeletal muscle loss and rescues cachexia phenotypes in advanced cancer models. These findings indicate that the IL36G-producing subset of neutrophil-like monocytes could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer cachexia."

Therefore, this study aimed to establish the association between WBRT and the development of lymphopenia in patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy (RT), along with evaluating the corresponding clinical outcomes. Including 116 patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy, the study collected the absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) within 2 weeks before brain radiotherapy (pre-radiotherapy, pre-RT), as well as ones at 1 and 2 months after completing RT (post-RT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify associations between radiation modality and post-RT ALC. The relationships between post-RT ALC and overall survival were evaluated with Kaplan–Meier analysis and a multivariate Cox regression model. The median ALC definitely decreased at 1 month post-RT, but at 2 months post-RT, gradually rose but not to the pre-RT ALC. The multivariate analysis identified WBRT and lower pre-RT ALC as independent risk factors associated with the decrease in post-RT ALC at 1 month. It also revealed more than 4 brain metastases, G3-4 lymphopenia at 1 month and lower post-RT ALC at 2 months exhibited significantly worse prognosis regardless of the radiation modality. However, there was indeed an independent correlation between radiation modality and the outcome of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). To approach the feasibility and reasonableness of treatment, clinicians should carefully consider various factors to achieve long-term survival of patients."

The data of hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancer patients who underwent BCS were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015. All patients were separated into two groups, namely, the RT group and the no radiotherapy (No RT) group. The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were compared between the No RT and RT groups after propensity score matching (PSM). The nomograms for predicting the survival of patients were constructed from variables identified by univariate or multivariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 2504 patients were enrolled in the training cohort, and 630 patients were included in the validation cohort. After PSM, 738 patients were enrolled in the No RT group and RT group. We noted that RT can improve survival in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who undergo BCS. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, age, race, tumour grade, receipt of RT and chemotherapy, pathological T stage, N status, M status and HER2 status were linked to OS and CSS for these patients, and nomograms for predicting OS and CSS were constructed and validated. Moreover, RT improved OS and CSS in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who underwent BCS. In addition, the proposed nomograms more accurately predicted OS and CSS for hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients after BCS."

Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that DP303c showed similar or better antitumor activity than T-DM1 in xenograft models. This was a multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion phase 1 study in China. Eligible patients were 18-75 years old with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors who were unable to benefit from standard therapy. DP303c was administered intravenously every 3 weeks, with accelerated titration at lower dose of 0.5 mg/kg and 3 + 3 design with dose levels of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 mg/kg at dose escalation part, followed by the selected dose level at dose expansion part. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, as well as identification of recommended phase 2 dose. As of Feb 28, 2023, 94 patients were enrolled and received DP303c (dose escalation: n = 22; dose expansion: n = 72), of whom 68 patients had breast cancer. One dose limiting toxicity (Grade 3 eye pain) was observed at 4.0 mg/kg dose, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common treatment-related adverse events at grade 3 or higher were blurred vison (16.0%), dry eye (6.4%), and peripheral neuropathy (5.3%). No treatment-related death occurred.
